# Foraging Map
### version 1.0

## Eat the wilderness
:blueberries::strawberry::green_apple::cherries:

***Foraging Map*** is a web application showing foraging spots around the world.

You can create your own foraging spot :compass: and add the type of plant you found there. 

Even if you don't log in you can see all the spots created by other users. 

## Start tailwind

Tailwind is included as a standalone CLI configuration with an `tailwindcss` executable in the `frontend/` folder.

To run the CSS watching, navigate to /frontend in the terminal
`cd frontend`

Start a watcher
`./tailwindcss -i assets/css/input.css -o assets/css/output.css --watch --minify`

## APIs Used

This application was built using [Trefle API](https://trefle.io/) and [Leaflet API](https://leafletjs.com/).

Trefle API was used to search and add foraging plant type to a spot. 

Leaflet API was used to display the map, locate a spot and access the location's coordination.
